thing to try

1.  when someone doesn't win, print the board and show where the battleship was with 'B'
    - change the x to b 
    - print the board as is
2.  When their guess is within 2 columns and 2 rows, tell them that they are getting closer
    - subtract guess from answer
    - if answer is 2 or less, then print "You're getting closer..."

Make multiple battleships: you’ll need to be careful because you need to make sure that you don’t place battleships on top of each other on the game board. Y
ou’ll also want to make sure that you balance the size of the board with the number of ships so the game is still challenging and fun to play.

Make battleships of different sizes: this is trickier than it sounds. 
All the parts of the battleship need to be vertically or horizontally touching and 
you’ll need to make sure you don’t accidentally place part of a ship off the side of the board.

Make your game a two-player game.

Use functions to allow your game to have more features like rematches, statistics and more!

From Dad's email:
1. When the game begins, ask the user how big they want to board to be and how many turns they want.
2.  Add a function (a def, in python), called give_hint.  Call it after every guess.  Take the difference between their guess and the location of the battleship and give a hint.
If the difference between the guess column and the battleship position column and the guess row and battleship position row are 2 or less, give a hint like "Almost there, very hot!!!!" or something like that.
else if the difference (similar to above) is 3 or less, print a hint like "Getting closer!"
else, give a hint that says "not even close" or something like that. 
Later we'll make it so the number scales with size of the board.
